# HDPS
The repository contains the code and dataset in HDPS paradigm, which is currently being submitted to Nature Machine Intelligence.
The code is coming soon!
we proposed a new paradigm in deep learning, High-Dimensional Projection Selection(HDPS), which is applicable to most network architectures. HDPS integrates the relationship between the target manifold and the input manifold, merging their information interactions to construct a high-dimensional manifold. The foundational step in constructing this high-dimensional manifold lies in identifying the most fundamental properties inherent to the target domain. With that, we then seek to establish a connection between the source manifold and the target manifold, where we finally got a high-dimensional manifold. Through this high-dimensional manifold space, we establish a more effective mapping between the probability distributions of the given target and the input data. Notably, the proposed paradigm introduces several additional nodes to the traditional end-to-end neural network structure, which alleviates two key issues that have long constrained research in computer vision and computational imaging: the challenge of fitting complex distributions with limited samples and the unavoidable information-loosing in initial values.
